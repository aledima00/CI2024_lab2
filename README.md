Lab2 for the Computational Intelligence 2024-25 course @ Politecnico di Torino

The conent is in the self-explicative [jupyter noteook](tsp.ipynb) in the repo, so there is no need of further descriptions.

However, here i provide my results with all the given datasets in order to use them as a fast benchmark comparison:

| Dataset 	| Time taken (mm'ss") 	    | Result (cost-km) 	|
|---------	|-------------------------- |------------------	|
| vanuatu 	| ~ 00'02"              	| ~ 1346 km        	|
| italy   	| ~ 00'29"              	| ~ 4367 km        	|
| russia  	| ~ 02'17"              	| ~ 37648 km       	|
| us      	| ~ 04'42"              	| ~ 45457 km       	|
